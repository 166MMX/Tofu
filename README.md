# Tofu

An easy-to-use, open-source two-factor authentication app designed specifically
for iOS.

Tofu generates one-time passwords to help you protect your online accounts.
These passwords are used together with your normal password when you sign into
services like Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Amazon, and GitHub.

Tofu works with all services that provide two-factor authentication using the
HOTP and TOTP algorithms. It does not require a network or cellular connection
and can be used in airplane mode.

## Installation

Tofu is available for free on the App Store.
